# Cycle Log (append-only)

One block per cycle event: `ingest` (scout), `score` (curator), `integrate` (handshake), `lint`.

## [2026-07-23] scaffold | Vault created
- Created: SCHEMA.md, index.md, overview.md, ledger.md, log.md, inbox/, sources/, patterns/, ideas/

## [2026-07-23] ingest | Cycle 1 — dual research (codex + scout)
- L0 codex brief: `inbox/research-brief-2026-07-23.md` (8 sources, 9 ideas; generator gpt-5-deep-research).
- L1 scout live research: `inbox/scout-notes-2026-07-23.md` (w1–w4). Corroborated 5 codex ideas; added frontmatter-fields + AutoGen-maintenance-mode fact; flagged star-count contradiction.

## [2026-07-23] score | Cycle 1 — curator
- Deduped vs ledger (empty). Scored merged candidate set.
- Accepted: **handoff-contract** (91). Deferred: 9 others (circuit-breaker cap = 3; cycle 1 conservative → 1 accepted).
- Safety veto applied; none touched the carve-out.

## [2026-07-23] integrate | Cycle 1 — ADR-004 + convention
- @architect wrote ADR-004; created `docs/conventions/handoff-contract.md`.
- Gate (guardian/sentinel/challenger): PASS (no role break, no injection/carve-out/secret, real improvement; challenger deferred-impact caveat noted).
- Landing: **shadow (pr)** → branch `owl/evolve-2026-07-23-handoff-contract`; main untouched.
